## üéÆ About Glitch

Set in the imagination of 11 giants, players could explore a colorful world, cook elaborate meals, learn skills, chat with NPCs, and collaborate with other players in a non-violent, creativity-focused environment. Though the game shut down in 2012, its assets live on through this open-source repository.
